### Description
Introducing nowPaper: An application designed to allow easy access to Google Now-inspired wallpapers. With nowPaper, you can apply beautiful wallpapers/backgrounds that are based on or replicate Google Now's stunning abstract landscapes and cities. The wallpapers are available in Ultra HD (4K) and Full HD (1080p). Each design is created from scratch by talented artist, [Alex Pasquarella](https://alexpasquarella.com).


Muzei support with automatic time-based cycling is also included! nowPaper has an extension for the extremely popular live-wallpaper app Muzei. This allows the included Google Now-inspired wallpapers to cycle based on time (corresponding to dawn, day, dusk, and night). With the Muzei extension, you can use 4K resolution wallpapers for select locations. That way you can fully utilize your QHD display. There is also an option to have nowPaper choose a random location each day, so you wake up to a fresh home screen every morning.
